* `<kbd>` - The HTML Keyboard Input element (`<kbd>`) represents a span of inline text denoting textual user input from a keyboard, voice input, or any other text entry device. By convention, the user agent defaults to rendering the contents of a` <kbd>` element using its default monospace font, although this is not mandated by the HTML standard.
* `transitionend` event - The `transitionend` event is fired when a CSS transition has completed. In the case where a transition is removed before completion, such as if the transition-property is removed or display is set to "none", then the event will not be generated.
